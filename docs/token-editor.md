# Token editor

Turn any picture into a VTT-ready token without leaving Grimoire - and without writing
anything into your library.

---

Turn any picture into a VTT-ready token without leaving Grimoire. Open it from the
**Token editor** button on the tokens page, from a token's own page, or - the quickest
route - from a character's portrait in a campaign's member list.

Load art by uploading a file, pasting from the clipboard, dropping it on the page, or
browsing what Grimoire already holds. Browsing offers your token library and nothing else -
book covers, album art, and battlemaps are none of them a character portrait, and tokens are
already the collection of character images. Anything filed elsewhere is still one upload
away. Then position it: drag to move, scroll to zoom,
`Shift`+scroll to rotate, and the arrow keys to nudge a pixel at a time. On a touchscreen,
drag with one finger and pinch or twist with two. Double-click (or press `R`) to start over.

You choose a frame, the output size (140, 256, 512, or 1024 pixels), and an optional
background colour behind transparent art. The frame decides the token's shape - pick an
ornate border and the art is cropped to its opening. For a plain round or square token with no
visible border, pick the circle or square frame and set its colour to **None**: the shape still
does the cropping, it just draws nothing. With no frame at all you get the full square image.
The finished token is a PNG with real transparency.

**Two ways out.** **Download** saves the PNG to your device, ready to drop into Roll20,
Foundry, or anything else. **Send to a campaign** offers whichever of two destinations you
have the standing for:

- **Send to a character** - the games you play in, one row per character. It becomes that
  character's VTT token, kept separately from their portrait so making a token never
  overwrites their artwork. Because setting your own character's things has always been
  something a player can do, players can make their own tokens, not just GMs.
- **Send to a campaign you GM** - one row per campaign rather than per character, so running
  four games does not bury them under twenty characters. Pick a campaign and you then choose
  either **Set as a character token** - which lists just that campaign's characters - or a
  resource category, defaulting to the built-in **Tokens** group.

You are only shown the paths that apply to you: a player with no campaign of their own never
sees the GM route, and someone in no campaigns at all is told so rather than offered a
destination that would be refused.

Opening the editor from a character's portrait is the exception - it already knows who the
token is for, so the button simply sets that character's art.

Nothing is written to your library and no new token is added to it: the image is composed in
your browser and only leaves by one of those two doors. That means the editor works fine on
a read-only library, and never disturbs a scan.

**Frames.** Five ship with Grimoire. Two are plain shapes - a circle and a square - which
take any colour you pick, and three are themed role markers (player
character, non-player character, opponent) that keep their own colour, since that colour is
part of telling them apart at a glance. You can add your own as well. Mark any folder under `tokens/` as a frame folder - right-click
it in the [file manager](file-management.md) and choose **Mark as frame folder**, or
tick the box when creating it - and every PNG, WebP, or SVG inside becomes a frame. (That
writes an empty `.frames-container` file, which you can equally create by hand.) The folder keeps a
normal name - `Fantasy Frames`, `Scifi Frames` - and the picker groups frames under it, so
a system's frames can sit beside that system's tokens.

Frame images are still indexed as ordinary tokens and appear in your token gallery. That is
deliberate: a frame *is* a token image, just one you would normally composite rather than
place on a map. Add a [`.grimoireignore`](library-structure.md#ignoring-files-with-grimoireignore) rule if you
would rather they stayed out of the gallery. Both the tokens page and
[in-app file management](file-management.md) badge a folder holding the marker with
**Frames**, at whatever depth it sits, so you can see which folders feed the editor.

**Finding a frame.** A large collection stays manageable: the frame list scrolls in place
rather than pushing the page down, each folder group collapses, and a search box filters by
frame name or folder. Favouriting a frame is the same as favouriting anything else - star it
in your token gallery, and it appears in a **Favourites** group at the top of the picker. It
stays listed under its own folder too, so a frame never moves out from where you filed it.

Hovering a frame shows it **enlarged beside the list**. A picker tile is small enough to fit
a few hundred frames on screen but too small to judge one by - the thing that decides between
two ornate borders is the detail in the border - so the tiles stay small and a hover shows the
frame at a size you can actually read.

**Frames that are versions of one another.** A frame folder often holds the same ring more
than once: a black-and-white cut beside the colour original, a thinner weight, a recoloured
set. Link them in [duplicate detection](file-management.md#duplicates-and-multiple-versions) the way you would
any other file, and the picker shows **one tile** for the frame rather than the same ring
several times over. Selecting it lists its versions in the space the colour swatches occupy
for the built-in shapes - the two never both apply, since a frame from your library is a file
and takes no colour - each named the way versions are named everywhere else ("Black and
white · v2"). Picking one keeps the frame's own tile lit, so stepping back to the original is
one click.

**Choosing which version of your art to frame.** The same applies to the picture you are
turning into a token. When the image you pick from your library has other versions, they are
offered under it and you choose which one the token is made from - the colour portrait or its
black-and-white cut are different tokens, and which one you want is not a detail Grimoire
should pick for you.

The editor reads a frame's crop **from the frame itself** - it fills inward from the centre
and keeps whatever the frame encloses - so a frame can be any shape, and the art follows its
real outline rather than a circle. The one requirement is that the outline be **closed**: a
border with a gap in it lets the fill escape, and the editor falls back to a plain circular
crop. (That is why the bundled non-player-character frame bridges its decorative notch with a
small bar.) Frames should be square overall, with a transparent middle, and for SVGs you must
set explicit `width` and `height` attributes alongside the `viewBox` - Firefox and Safari
cannot draw one without them. The bundled frames use a `0 0 512 512` viewBox and are worth
copying as a starting point.
