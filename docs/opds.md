# OPDS catalog

Grimoire serves the [OPDS 1.2](https://specs.opds.io/opds-1.2) catalog format, so e-reader
apps - Panels, Chunky, KyBook, KOReader - can browse and download from your library
directly.

---

## Enabling OPDS

Set `OPDS_ENABLED=true` and `BASE_URL` to your instance's public URL in your compose file:

```yaml
environment:
  OPDS_ENABLED: "true"
  BASE_URL: "https://grimoire.example.com"
```

## Personal feed URLs

OPDS access is per-user. Each user generates their own opaque feed URL in **Settings → Account → OPDS Feed**. The URL contains a long random token - no username or password is needed by the OPDS client.

Guest accounts are campaign-scoped and do not get an OPDS feed: OPDS reports as unavailable for them, they cannot generate a token, and the feed rejects any token belonging to a guest.

- **Enable** - generates a unique feed URL
- **Copy** - copies the URL to the clipboard
- **Regenerate** - issues a new token; the old URL stops working immediately
- **Disable** - revokes the token; the feed URL stops working immediately

## Feed URL structure

```
https://grimoire.example.com/opds/{token}          ← navigation root
https://grimoire.example.com/opds/{token}/all       ← all books
https://grimoire.example.com/opds/{token}/entry/{id}  ← single book
https://grimoire.example.com/opds/{token}/download/{id}  ← file download
```

## Content filtering

The OPDS feed respects each user's explicit-content preference. Users with explicit content disabled will not see explicit books in their feed and cannot download them via OPDS.
